# Jumpfrog is an ongoing personal robotics project.
The robot is driven by six LX-16A bus servos and controlled remotely through Raspberry Pi. 
<br/>The control system is based on ROS,
and two different control strategies (sin wave motor control and reinforment learning) is tried on the robot.
<br/>Inventor and 3D printer help me to quick iterating and prototyping my design.

#### ##TODO:
1. Add IMU to enable close loop control.
2. Install stereo motor for future SLAM application
